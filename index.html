<p>After thinking about how binning influences distributions in one dimension (see our <a href="http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/" target="_blank">essay about histograms</a>), we wanted to explore how the same effect worked in two dimensions. Although there are many two-dimensional data representations, maps seemed like a natural fit. </p>

<p>This interactive lets you explore how the size, shape, and orientation of spatial bins impact the distribution. Each bin is colored according to how many points are aggregated into it. Spatial statisticians often call this sort of aggregation &quot;upscaling,&quot; and the variety of distributions that can result from the same underlying point data has applications in many areas, particularly elections.</p>

<p>We are not the first ones to notice how much of a difference the boundaries of spatial bins can make. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering" target="_blank">Gerrymandering</a> is a term for manipulating voter district boundaries that was coined in 1812. In more recent years, The Washington Post has created a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/?utm_term=.51914abd2148" target="_blank">ubiquitous static graphic</a> illustrating gerrymandering, and there are other interactives like <a href="http://redistrictinggame.org/index.php" target="_blank">The Redistricting Game</a> and <a href="http://polytrope.com/district/" target="_blank">District</a> that allow players to explore the effect themselves.</p>
